# Exoticca Datatable

### Frontend Technical Assignment

The goal of the assignment is: table with data that allows showing and filtering entities.

## Deployed in Netlify

https://singular-creponne-c3de03.netlify.app/

## Features to implement:

- [x] Show data in a table (using https://material-ui.com/ or https://styled-components.com/)
  - [x] Using react-query (https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/queries) handle getting posts from mocked API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide)
  - [x] as a bonus can implement the option to edit
- [x] Support filtering data by "title"
- [x] All the posts with ids as prime numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_numbers) should have the title in the table shown in italic ðŸ™ƒ

Note: Using **TypeScript** and **tests** is mandatory. Keep in mind components should be reusable.

# Running it locally

This project has been developed using `React, Typescript, Vite and PNPM`.

## Scripts

Once the project has been cloned, install it with:

```
pnpm install
```

Then you will be able to run it with:

```
pnpm run dev
```

Its tests can be run using:

```
pnpm run test
```

##Â Note
Error handling is something I haven't been able to implement properly and would have been my next step. Also if I had more time my tests would have been more thorough but I have tried to get somes that would help in general terms.
